# Typography Exercise

In this exercise you will pair fonts for two completely different audiences. Below is a brief for each use case:

1. Pair 2 fonts together for a digital advertisement for a brand new water park that is having a grand opening. One font should be for the title and the other font is for the content of the ad.
2. Pair 2-3 fonts together for a children's learning how to read app. One font is for the titles, and the others are used for the content that the user will learn to read on.

Your job is to look through some free fonts on the internet, download them, and then attach them to html. 

- <www.fontspace.com>
- <www.fonts.google.com>
- <www.fontsquirrel.com>

Note: If you use Google Fonts you don't have to download the font file, instead you can reference it in the html using `<link/>` and then reference it in the `font-family` CSS property. 

## Deliverables

- Add at least 4 fonts (2 for water park and 2 for learning to read app)
- Write 2-3 sentences, for each brief, on why you choose the fonts and why you think they pair well together.
